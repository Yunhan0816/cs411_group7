Idea 1: People having difficulties keeping track of their mental health statistics consisting of what they do and how they feel, and they want to find an optimal way of managing their mood. Hence, we came up with the idea of creating a mood tracker application that allows users to enter their daily data on mental health conditions. We want the website to have a calendar view for users to enter their daily data of mood, activities they did, a weather view for users to check daily weather, and a music view that shuffles songs from Spotify playlist. There will be a weather API and a Spotify API.

Idea 2: There is a lack of connections within the musician community, for example, a lot of bands are having a hard time finding like-minded people/musician to hold a jam session together. We want to build a jam finder app that allows college musicians to enter their information, for instance, their experience of musical instruments, favorite artists and genre. This will be posted on a public feed for users to see and chat. There will be a public feed view with posts of musicians wanted, and a network view that enables collaborations and discussions for musicians. API planning to be used: Gmap API, Spotify API, and Indaba Music API.
